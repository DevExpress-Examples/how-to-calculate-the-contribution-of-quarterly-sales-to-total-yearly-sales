# Dashboard for WinForms - How to Calculate the Contribution of Quarterly Sales to Total Yearly Sales.


This example shows howÂ to calculate a contribution of individual quarter sales to the grand total sales.

## Example Structure

In this example, the [Pivot](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15266/winforms-dashboard/winforms-designer/create-dashboards-in-the-winforms-designer/dashboard-item-settings/pivot) dashboard item displays the sum of sales by year/quarter. The Sales field is placed in the [Values](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15456/winforms-dashboard/winforms-designer/create-dashboards-in-the-winforms-designer/dashboard-item-settings/pivot/providing-data) section and the hierarchy of OrderDate fields (with the Year and Quarter [group intervals](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15693/winforms-dashboard/winforms-designer/create-dashboards-in-the-winforms-designer/data-shaping/grouping)) is placed in [Rows](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15456/winforms-dashboard/winforms-designer/create-dashboards-in-the-winforms-designer/dashboard-item-settings/pivot/providing-data).

The following expressions calculate quarterly sales as a percentage of total sales:

| Calculated Field | Expression |
| --- | --- |
| Grand Total Sales | ``` aggr(Sum([Sales])) ``` |
| Percent of Grand Total | ``` Sum([Sales]) / Sum([Grand Total Sales]) ``` |

The following screenshot demonstrates the final result:
